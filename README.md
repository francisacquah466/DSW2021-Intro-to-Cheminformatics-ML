# DSW2021- Intro to Cheminformatics and small molecule Machine Learning with Python
Data Science Workshop Presentation October 2021. 

This repository contains the jupyter notebook templates used in the DSW talk October 2021.


The notebook and resources are intended to give a beginner's guide to Cheminformatics and small molecule ML to anyone who is interested. 
The notebook is designed to be used within Google colab; 

Download this repository, and upload the .ipynb into Google Colab, or open the link below in a Jupyter instance.

_You can use it locally on your own machine if you have installed all the required dependencies_.
